### Installation
The code is based on Python 3 and uses the libraries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. The data used is taken from StackOverflowâ€™s 2017, 2018 and 2019 Annual Developer Survey dataset.

### Files
- 3 data files from StackOverflow's Survey of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019
- 1 Jupyter Notebook file with Python code
- 1 HTML file cotaining the blog post with 2 image files

### Results
Based on StackOverflow's Developers Survey we analyzed the trend of programming languages in Germany over the last three years. There is clear evidence which languages are a secure choice for developers to get acquainted with.
When looking at the results it becomes evident that the younger programming languages are in higher demand and usage. The older programming languages like C# aren't part of the upper five, but still occupy a spot in the top ranges. Even though subject to fluctuations, Python has increased in the usage as well as in the demand ratio over the last three years and is highly required in 2019 right after JavaScript.
